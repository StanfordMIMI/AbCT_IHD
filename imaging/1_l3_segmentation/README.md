# L3 Segmentation

A 2.5D UNet model was trained to obtain segmentations of fat and muscle from an L3 axial slice.

The code and documentation is made available at: [https://github.com/ad12/abCTSeg](https://github.com/ad12/abCTSeg).

In `IHD_ml_models_segmentation_fts.py`, bi-variate L2 logistic regression for predicting IHD output are trained.
